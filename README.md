- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander, I recently left the seminary where I spent 12-years of my life training to become a Roman Catholic priest. I'm not meant to be a priest. So, now...
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering. Actually, I graduated BS Computer Engineering prior to entering the seminary. I just returned to the world of Computers again.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and I'm currently busy with CS50x 2023 of Harvard University via Edx.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Python projects. My first language was C. I'm still learning C together with Python. I also know a bit of C++, C# and Java.
- 📫 How to reach me? Please email me at alexanderdaguob@gmail.com if you need my help for your projects or if you want to hire me. The projects I have here shows you so far my logical capacity and programming knowledge.
- I am still learning. I love learning. Oh, the very good feeling when you have found a solution to a certain problem!
