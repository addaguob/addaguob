<ul>    
    <li> 👋😄 Hi, I’m Alexander!
    <li> 👀 I recently enjoy engineering and developing programs in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and under its umbrella: <a href="https://flet.dev/docs/">Flet</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html">SQLite3</a> and <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>.
    <li> 🌱 Prior to my Software Engineering works:<br>I graduated <mark>BS Computer Engineering in 2010</mark> at AMA Computer College - Bacolod, Philippines. I thought I am called to the Catholic priesthood so I entered the Sacred Heart Seminary and finished <mark>AB Philosophy in 2013</mark>, graduated <mark>Bachelor in Sacred Theology in 2016</mark>, and then from 2017 to 2022, took <mark>Master of Arts and Licentiate in Sacred Theology, major in Social-Pastoral Communication</mark>. <strong>My superior and I discerned that I'm not meant for the Catholic priesthood and so in August 21, 2022, after 12 years of diocesan formation, I left the seminary</strong>. Since 2022 then, I'm into software engineering and I aspire to be like Blessed Carlo Acutis, a web designer and would-be first millennial saint.🙏
