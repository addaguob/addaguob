- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander.
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering using Python, JavaScript and Dart programming languages. I simply love Computer Programming.
- 🌱 I gradauated BS Computer Engineering in 2010 at AMA Computer College - Bacolod, Philippines. I entered the Sacred Heart Seminary and finished AB Philosophy in 2013. I graduated Bachelor in Sacred Theology in 2016. Then from 2017 to 2022, finished all units for the Master of Arts and Licentiate in Sacred Theology, majoy in Social-Pastoral Communication. My superior discerned that I'm not meant for the Catholic priesthood and so in August 21, 2022, after 12 years, I left the seminary. Since 2022 then, I'm into Software Engineering enjoying the thrill and adventure of developing CLI and GUI-type applications.
- 💞️ I love Harvard University's CS50x (Intro to Computer Science), CS50 Python programming, CS50 SQL Database querying and CS50 Web dev.
