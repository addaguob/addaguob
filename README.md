- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander.
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering. I love Computer Programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and I'm currently busy with CS50x 2023 of Harvard University via Edx.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Python projects. My first language was C. I completed basic programming of languages: C++, C# and Java at w3schools-dot-com.
- 📫 How to reach me? Please email me at alexanderdaguob@gmail.com if you need my help for your projects or if you want to hire me. The projects I have here show you so far my logical capacity and programming knowledge.
I am still learning. I love learning!
