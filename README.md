- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander.
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering. I love Computer Programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying CS50x (Intro to Computer Science) and CS50P (Python) of Harvard University. I gradauated BS Computer Engineering in 2010 at AMA Computer College - Bacolod. I entered the Sacred Heart Seminary and finished AB Philosophy and Sacred Theology. I did not make it to the Catholic priesthood after 12 years. I'm studying programming again.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Python projects. My first language was C. I completed basic programming of languages: C++, C# and Java at w3schools-dot-com.

I am still learning. I love learning!
