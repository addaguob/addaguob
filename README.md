- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander.
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering. I love Computer Programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying CS50x (Intro to Computer Science) and CS50P (Python) of Harvard University. I gradauated BS Computer Engineering in 2010 at AMA Computer College - Bacolod. I entered the Sacred Heart Seminary and finished AB Philosophy in 2013 and Sacred Theology in 2016. I did not make it to the Catholic priesthood after 12 years and left the seminary in August 21, 2022. I'm studying programming again.
