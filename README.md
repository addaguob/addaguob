    <li> 👋😄 Hi, I’m Alexander.
    <li> 👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering using Python, JavaScript and Dart programming languages. I simply love Computer Programming.
    <li> 🌱 Prior to my Software Engineering works:<br>I graduated <mark>BS Computer Engineering in 2010</mark> at AMA Computer College - Bacolod, Philippines. I entered the Sacred Heart Seminary and finished <mark>AB Philosophy in 2013</mark>. I graduated <mark>Bachelor in Sacred Theology in 2016</mark>. Then from 2017 to 2022, finished all units for the <mark>Master of Arts and Licentiate in Sacred Theology, major in Social-Pastoral Communication</mark>. <strong>My superior discerned that I'm not meant for the Catholic priesthood and so in August 21, 2022, after 12 years of diocesan formation, I left the seminary</strong>. Since 2022 then, I'm into Software Engineering enjoying the thrill and adventure of engineering and developing CLI and GUI-type applications. I aspire to be like Blessed Carlo Acutis, a web designer and would-be first millennial saint.🙏
